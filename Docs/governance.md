!!! This This is aset of governance standards will provide a foundation for managing ML projects effectively and professionally.  Remember to adapt and extend these standards as the project evolves.  Having a well-defined governance framework is crucial for long-term success.
#### I. Versioning and Metadata Management:    
1. ###### Project Versioning:
    * [Semantic Versioning](versioning.md) (SemVer) will be used for the overall project version (e.g., v1.2.3). This allows for clear communication of changes between releases.
    * The project version will be stored in the project_config.yaml file and updated with each release.
    * Git tags will be used to mark specific project versions in the repository.
2. ###### Component Versioning:
    * Versioning will be applied to individual components (data schemas, models, etc.) where applicable.
    * Component versions will also follow SemVer and be stored in the project_config.yaml file.
    * The project_metadata.json file will track the specific versions of each component used in a given project instance.
3. ###### Metadata Store:
    * A project_metadata.json file will serve as the central repository for all project metadata.
    * This file will include:
        * Project and component versions.
        * Data schema versions.
        * Model versions.
        * Docker image tags.
        * Creation timestamps.
        * Any other relevant metadata.
        * Metadata Updates:
    * Metadata will be updated programmatically using the update_metadata.py script (or a similar mechanism).
    * Updates will occur after key events, such as model training, data schema changes, or deployment.
    * This ensures that the metadata is always consistent and up-to-date.
#### II. Dependency Management:
1. ###### Dependency Declaration:
    * All project dependencies will be explicitly declared in the `requirements.txt file`.
    * This file will be generated and managed by the `create_project.py` script based on the dependencies specified in `project_config.yaml`.
2. ###### Virtual Environments:
    * Virtual environments will be used for all projects to isolate dependencies and prevent conflicts.
    * The setup script will automatically create a virtual environment if one doesn't exist.
3. ###### Dependency Updates:
    * Dependencies will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure compatibility and access to the latest features and security patches.
    * Dependency updates will be tested thoroughly before being incorporated into the project.
#### III. Security:
1. ###### Service Accounts (GCP):
    * Separate service accounts will be used for different components (e.g., DataFlow, Cloud Functions) to follow the principle of least privilege.
    * The governance section of the `project_config.yaml` file will define the allowed service accounts.
    * Components will reference these governance-defined service accounts using variable substitution (e.g., `$governance.service_account_dataflow`).
2. ###### Secrets Management:
    * Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) will never be stored directly in the configuration files or code.
    * A secure secrets management solution such as Vault or Google Cloud Secret Manager) will be used to store and access secrets.
3. Code Reviews:
    * All code changes will undergo a code review process before being merged into the main branch.
    * Code reviews will focus on security best practices, code quality, and adherence to the project's coding standards.
#### IV. Reproducibility:
1. ###### Configuration Management:
    * All project configurations will be stored in version-controlled configuration files (e.g., project_config.yaml).
    * This ensures that the project can be easily reproduced in different environments.
2. ###### Automated Build and Deployment:
    * Automated build and deployment pipelines will be used to minimize manual steps and ensure consistency.
    * These pipelines will use the configuration files and metadata to build and deploy the project.
3. ###### Data Versioning:
    * Data versioning will be implemented using appropriate tools (e.g., DVC, Git LFS) to track changes in datasets.
    * This allows for reproducibility of experiments and models.
#### V. Component Standards:
1. Naming Conventions:
    * Components will follow a consistent naming convention to clearly indicate their purpose and version (e.g., dataflow_process_files_and_load_to_bq_v1_2).
2. Code Style:
    * Code will adhere to a defined style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) to maintain consistency and readability.
3. Documentation:
    * All components will be well-documented, including their purpose, inputs, outputs, and dependencies.
#### VI. Governance Process:
1. Governance Committee:
    * A governance committee will be responsible for defining, maintaining, and enforcing these governance standards.
2. Standard Updates:
    * These standards will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect best practices and evolving project needs.
3. Enforcement:
    * The governance committee will ensure that all projects adhere to these standards.
