Let's break down Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and how it applies to your ML project template. SemVer is a widely adopted standard for versioning software, designed to communicate clearly what kinds of changes are included in each release.   

## Understanding Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

A SemVer version number has three parts, separated by periods:   
``` MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH ```
* **MAJOR:**  Increment this when you make incompatible changes to the API or project structure. This usually means that existing code that relies on the previous version will likely break and require modifications to work with the new version. [reference](<https://semver.org/#:~:text=Minor%20version%20Y%20(x.Y.z%20%7C%20x,introduced%20to%20the%20public%20API.>)  
* **MINOR:** Increment this when you add new functionality in a backward-compatible manner. Existing code should continue to work without [reference](<https://semver.org/#:~:text=Minor%20version%20Y%20(x.Y.z%20%7C%20x,introduced%20to%20the%20public%20API.>)
* **PATCH:** Increment this when you make bug fixes or small, backward-compatible changes that do not add new features. [reference](<https://semver.org/#:~:text=Minor%20version%20Y%20(x.Y.z%20%7C%20x,introduced%20to%20the%20public%20API.>)
### Applying SemVer to Your ML Project Template
Here's how SemVer applies to your ML project template and what kinds of changes would trigger each version increment:

###### 1.  Initial Version:
Start with 0.1.0 (or 0.0.1 if it's a very early, pre-alpha version). The 0 in the MAJOR version indicates that the project is still in development and the API/structure might change significantly.

###### 2.  Changes and Version Updates:
* ###### MAJOR Version Increment (e.g., 0.2.0, 1.0.0, 2.0.0):
    * Changes to the fundamental structure of the generated project (e.g., renaming core directories, significantly altering the `project_config.yaml` schema in an incompatible way).
    * Changes to the core dependencies that are not backward compatible.
    * Removal of essential functionality that other projects may rely on.
    * Incompatible changes to the metadata structure or how it is managed.
    * A complete rewrite or redesign of a significant portion of the template.
* ###### MINOR Version Increment (e.g., 0.1.1, 0.2.0, 1.1.0):
    * Adding new components or subfolders to the generated project structure.
    * Adding new configuration options to `project_config.yaml` without breaking existing configurations.
    * Adding support for new ML frameworks or tools.
    * Introducing new features to the create_project.py script.
    * Adding new metadata fields to track (as long as they are optional).
    * Enhancements or improvements to the documentation.
* ###### PATCH Version Increment (e.g., 0.1.0, 0.1.2, 1.0.1):
    * Bug fixes in the `create_project.py` script.
    * Minor improvements to the generated project structure (e.g., fixing typos in file names, adjusting whitespace).
    * Small updates to the documentation to clarify existing features.
    * Updating dependencies to newer versions that are backward compatible.
    * Changes to build scripts or CI/CD configurations.
###### 3. Examples:
* You add a new component to the generated project structure (e.g., a "reporting" component): Increment the MINOR version.   
* You fix a bug in the `create_project.py` script that was causing an error: Increment the PATCH version.
* You completely redesign the way dependencies are managed in the generated projects, requiring users to update their configurations: Increment the MAJOR version.
You add a new, optional configuration setting to project_config.yaml: Increment the MINOR version.
###### 4.  Pre-release Versions:
For development versions before a full release, you can use pre-release identifiers:
* `1.0.0-alpha`
* `1.0.0-beta`
* `1.0.0-rc.1 (Release Candidate)`

###### 5.  Build Metadata:

You can add build metadata to a version number (useful for CI/CD):

* `1.0.0+build.123`
* `1.0.0+sha.a1b2c3d4`
##### Workflow:
1. Plan Changes: Before making any changes, decide what type of version increment is appropriate.
2. Make Changes: Implement your changes.
3. Update Version: Update the version field in your project_config.yaml file according to SemVer.
4. Commit and Tag: Commit your changes and create a Git tag that matches the new version number.

***
By following SemVer, you provide clear information to users of your ML project template about the nature of changes in each release. This makes it easier for them to decide whether to upgrade and how much work might be involved in adapting to the new version.  It's a best practice for maintainable and collaborative projects.
